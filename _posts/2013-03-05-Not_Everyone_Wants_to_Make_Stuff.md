title: Not Everyone Wants to Make Stuff
---

I’m a naturally creative person, for the most part my hobbies involve creating stuff. I love writing code and being able to turn abstract ideas of functionality into something tangible. I love taking photos, which lets me construct images from what I see around me. I love making coffee, where I’m able to use my skill to create a beverage that both myself and others are able to enjoy. And finally, the only game I play regularly is [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org/en/), which involves creating intricate train networks.

When I go a day without making something I feel mopey and unaccomplished. My close friends are people that I’ve met through these creative activities, which means that I’m constantly surrounded by people who share my creative outlook.

Recently I had a conversation with a friend from my former high school, and I asked her what her hobbies were. She responded with “reading and exercise”. Now there’s nothing wrong with those hobbies, and she’s very smart, studying to be a dentist, but nothing that she does involve the insatiable desire to create.

Her values are fuelled by a desire for safety and stability. This contrasts drastically with me. If I were to have a stable, average, job living a stereotypical idealistic lifestyle, I’d see that as a failure. I don’t have any attraction to a run-of-the-mill middle class life. The inverse is also true, with my friend unable to see the attraction of being able to work with total freedom, and only getting paid when your client gets their accountant to get their act together, or one of your customers upgrades from your free tier to your paid one.

There is a marked distinction between service jobs, ones in which a worker gets out exactly what they put in, and creative jobs, whereby what can be received can be exponential. A truck driver doing his rounds will only ever be able to complete a certain number of deliveries in a day, while a musician writing a song can then publish that to the entire world. Linearity lends itself to stability, where you get out exactly what you put in. While exponentiality is inherently risky, and can either lead to painful failure or dramatic success.

We as creators, we are inherently outside of the norm, we chose to take these risks, for better or for worse, and due to the fact that we surround ourselves with like-minded people, we find that fact very easy to forget. Because we are creators, our perspective to both what we have made and what others have made can be dramatically different from consumers, who will be the end user of whatever it is that we’re creating.

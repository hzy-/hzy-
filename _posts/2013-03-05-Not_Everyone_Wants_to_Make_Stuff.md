# Not Everyone Wants to Make Stuff

I’m a naturally creative person, for the most part my hobbies involve creating stuff. I love writing code and being able to turn abstract ideas of functionality into something tangiable. I love taking photos, which lets me cronstruct images from what I see around me. I love making coffee, where I’m able to use my skill to create a beverage that both myself and others are able to enjoy. And finally, the only game I play regularly is OpenTTD, which involves creating intricate train networks.

When I go a day without making something I feel mopey and unaccomplished. My close friends are people that I’ve met through these creative activities, which means that I’m constantly surrounded by people who share my creative outlook.

Recently I had a conversation with a friend from my former high school, and I asked her what her hobbies were. She responded with “reading and exercise”. Now there’s nothing wrong with those hobbies, and she’s very smart, studying to be a dentist, but nothing that she does involve the insatiable desire to create.

Her values are fueled by a desire for safety and stability. This constrasts drastically with me. If I were to have a stable, average, job living a steretypical idealistic lifestyle, I’d see that as a failure. I don’t have any attraction to a run-of-the-mill middle class life. The inverse is also true, with my friend unable to see the attraction of being able to work with total freedom, and only getting paid when your client gets their accountant to get their act together, or one of your customers upgrades from your free tier to your paid one.

This made me realise that we as creators, we are inheritly outside of the norm, and due to the fact that we surround ourselves with like-minded people, we find that fact very easy to forget. Because we are creators, our perspective to both what we have made and what others have made can be dramatically different from the consumers, who will be the end user of the thing being created.

## Work Examples

### [New HotCopper](http://beta.hotcopper.com)

Worked as part of a development team of 3 for roughly 9 months to built up the new HotCopper. Primarily worked as a Coffeescript developer, the project ended up with ~4000 lines of code. Used jQuery, Underscore.js, Require.js, and a myriad of jQuery plugins. Also involved in high level decisions of the site, looking at the core of features on the existing site and designing even better ones to replace them. Unfortunately this project has been shelved indefinitely.

### Amanda Australia Power Dispatch System *Demonstration on request*

AmandaAP is a demand side management (DSM) company, when asked by Western Power they notify their clients that they have to turn their power off-grid and to backup generators. This system allows them to fill out [a simple form](http://cl.ly/image/1E1s3y3x1t2W) which then sends out SMSs and emails to their contact personnel database. It then [keeps track of responses](http://cl.ly/image/3N002B2W2C2b). Using Python, Django, Celery (Message queue library), and Twilio API.

### [Mailify](http://mailify.co/signin/) *Signin with tester / tester*

Mailify is intended to be a web application that is a mailing list for small teams, where Hipchat, Campfire, etc, aren't a good fit as most people aren't online at the same time. It's only at an early stage, as it's a side-project I started to teach myself clientside MVC. Currently inbound and outbound email is functional, along with the email reading interface. Using Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Python, Django, and Lamson (pythonic email server).

*More examples can be provided on request.*

## Work Examples

### [New HotCopper](http://beta.hotcopper.com)

Worked as part of a development team of 3 for roughly 9 months to built up the new HotCopper. Primarily worked as a Coffeescript developer, the project ended up with ~4000 lines of code. Used jQuery, Underscore.js, Require.js, and a myriad of jQuery plugins. Also involved in high level decisions of the site, looking at the core of features on the existing site and designing even better ones to replace them. Unfortunately this project has been shelved indefinitely.

### [Mailify](http://mailify.co/signin/) *Signin with tester / tester*

Mailify is intended to be a web application that is a mailing list for small teams, where Hipchat, Campfire, etc, aren't a good fit as most people aren't online at the same time. It's only at an early stage, as it's a side-project I started to teach myself clientside MVC. Currently inbound and outbound email is functional, along with the email reading interface. Using Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Python, Django, and Lamson.


### [Energy Made Clean Interest Form](http://energymadeclean.com/index.php/our-business/power/registeryourinterest)

Used Twitter Bootstrap to quickly create a web form that inserts a potential client's details into their CRM, Solve360. Form processing done in PHP, then inserted to Solve360 via their API. jQuery validation plugin used extensively.
